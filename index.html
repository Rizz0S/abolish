        Abolishing the police isn’t about establishing some kind of free-for-all anarchy where everybody polices themselves and you just hope that nobody decides to police themselves into robbing you or killing you.?

        Abolishing the police is about the end of policing *as we know it.* It’s about recognizing that the role policing plays in our society is not a role that it should have ever been given or that we should allow it to continue to have.?

        Abolishing the police is about recognizing that if we took away from the police every single public issue that they should have never been given to fix in the first place, the police would literally have nothing to do because we’ve turned them into “social workers” with guns.
